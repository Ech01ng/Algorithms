// Enqueue operation
procedure enqueue(A, rear, front, data)
   if rear = SIZE - 1 then
     print "Queue is full"
     return
   end if

   if front = -1 and rear = -1 then
     front = rear = 0
     
   else
     rear = rear + 1
   end if

   A[rear] = data

end procedure

// Dequeue operation
function dequeue(A, rear, front)
   if front = -1 then
     print "Queue is empty"
     return -1
   end if

   data = A[front]
   if front = rear then
     front = rear = -1

   else
     front = front + 1
