A:

What is an algorithm?
A step-by-step procedure or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations.

4 Key properties:
- Unambiguity
- Finiteness
- Effectivenes
- Input and Output

An example of a real life algorithm is baking a cake:
It has an input (ingridients and quantities)
a procedure (step by step instructions)
output (the cake)
Unambiguity (each step is clearly defined)
Finiteness (reciepe ends after a number of steps)
Effectivenes (practical and can be carried out with common resources)

B:

1. Set the lower bound to 1 and the upper bound to 1000.
2. Set the number of guesses to 0.
3. Repeat the following steps until the number is guessed or the maximum number of guesses is reached:
   4. Increment the number of guesses by 1.
   5. Guess the number in the middle of the current range (lower bound + upper bound) / 2.
   6. If the guessed number is correct, exit the loop.
   7. If the guessed number is higher than the target number, set the upper bound to the guessed number - 1.
   8. If the guessed number is lower than the target number, set the lower bound to the guessed number + 1.
9. If the number is not guessed within the maximum number of guesses, indicate failure.
